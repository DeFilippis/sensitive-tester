                                On the next page, we want you to estimate the fraction of participants in this study that gave each kind of answer to the questions asked we just asked about.

                                Specifically, you will be asked to move sliders to estimate the percentage of participants who gave answers that fell into the 0-3, 4-6, and 7-10 range.
